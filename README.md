# Usage

## Gitlab + Slack

1. Define `GITLAB_TOKEN` in .env file. 
* `GITLAB_TOKEN` is used to check if request came from GitLab. 
* `GITLAB_TOKEN` should be set as webhook **secret token** in GitLab [More information about GitLab webhooks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html).

2. Config `../config/webhook-notifier.php` file
* Slack incomming webook urls should be always defined in .env file because they contain secret to your channel and can be blocked if they are leaked. [More information about Slack Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)
* `all` array - send all supported notifications to defined channels
* `push` array - send all push notifications to defined channels
